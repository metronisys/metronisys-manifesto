## Introduction

Decision boundaries are *explicit limits* grounded in the Metronisys™ principles that constrain actions, agent behavior, automation choices, and human‑AI interaction. They ensure that decisions — whether made by humans or AI agents — remain aligned with sustainable wellbeing, identity coherence, appropriate autonomy, and ethical priorities. These boundaries translate principles (attention sovereignty, energy‑first living, identity stability, AI augmentation, rhythmic structure, and purposeful simplicity) into *what must not happen* or *what must always be checked* in any decision path. 1

## 1. Attention Boundaries

**Definition:** Preserve deep human attention by preventing decisions that:
- Increase fragmentation of focus without clear value.
- Prioritize interrupt‑driven work over uninterrupted priority blocks.

**Boundaries**
- Do not schedule or approve actions that interrupt focused work unless they have higher priority than the current task.
- Agents must not inject notifications or ambient output that exceed predefined interruption thresholds.
- Decisions that introduce constant context switching must be constrained unless explicitly justified.

---

## 2. Energy Boundaries

**Definition:** Protect long‑term energy by preventing decisions that drive unsustainable effort without recovery.

**Boundaries**
- Avoid choices that extend effort cycles without scheduled restoration periods.
- Disallow escalation of workload when human energy indicators are below sustainable thresholds (e.g., chronic fatigue or overload metrics).
- Agents must propose reduced scope options rather than escalate when energy signals are weak.

---

## 3. Identity Boundaries

**Definition:** Maintain identity coherence by restricting decisions that conflict with declared human values and long‑term priorities.

**Boundaries**
- Do not pursue actions that fundamentally contradict core values or stated identity narratives.
- Agents must verify alignment with identity memory before recommending or automating life plans or commitments.
- Identity conflicts must trigger *clarification queries* rather than automatic acceptance.

---

## 4. AI Autonomy Boundaries

**Definition:** Constrain autonomous AI actions to prevent agency erosion or unsafe delegation.

**Boundaries**
- Do not automate tasks where human agency or mastery is essential to wellbeing or skill preservation.
- Autonomous actions must not exceed approved scope or permissions without a clear governance checkpoint.
- Agents must not assume control over non‑reversible domain actions without explicit human approval.

---

## 5. Rhythmic Boundaries

**Definition:** Ensure decisions respect natural human and ecological rhythms rather than rigid or endless cycles.

**Boundaries**
- Do not ignore physiological rhythms when assigning or approving cycles of work or rest.
- Decisions should not impose continuous, high‑intensity activity without designated rest/recovery phases.
- Agents should prefer rhythm‑aligned pacing (cycles of deep effort + restoration).

---

## 6. Simplicity Boundaries

**Definition:** Prevent unnecessary complexity or scope creep that diminishes clarity or overloads cognitive capacity.

**Boundaries**
- Avoid adding layers of tasks, metrics, or objects that do not directly align with prioritized outcomes.
- Agents must recommend the *minimum effective plan* rather than maximal scope execution.
- Decisions that introduce complexity without clear value must default to simpler alternatives.

---

## 7. Transparency & Explanation Boundaries

**Definition:** Every decision that affects human state or system behavior must be traceable, explainable, and human‑understandable.

**Boundaries**
- Do not execute or recommend actions without producing an accessible rationale.
- Agents must produce boundary justification when modifying or blocking a proposed action.
- Decisions must be logged with *policy version, threshold context, and reasoning traces*.

---

## 8. Safety & Irreversibility Boundaries

**Definition:** Prevent irreversible or unsafe actions without validated checks and human consent.

**Boundaries**
- Do not perform irreversible changes (e.g., destructive commands, permanent deletions, identity shifts) without human re‑confirmation.
- Agents must warn and require explicit approval for actions that cannot be undone.
- Decisions with systemic risk must defer to human governance checkpoints.

## Boundaries in Action — Use Cases

### Example: Attention Guard
A task that distracts a user from focus blocks if deeper focus is active.

### Example: Energy Guard
If energy index is low, agents automatically propose reduced scope or rest support tasks.

### Example: Identity Guard
If a proposed goal conflicts with core values, the agent asks for explicit reassessment.
