# Metronisys × Holacracy  
## Human-First Governance for Autonomous Organizations

### Integrating Organizational AI Governance with Human Sustainability

---

## Executive Summary

As AI systems become capable of autonomous decision-making and execution, organizations face a new challenge:

> How do we scale autonomy **without eroding human wellbeing, agency, or identity?**

Holacracy and Metronisys address this challenge from **complementary directions**.

- **Holacracy** governs *how organizations make decisions*
- **Metronisys** governs *what organizations and AI systems are allowed to demand of humans*

Together, they form a **complete AI governance stack**:
- Organizational governance (structure, roles, policy)
- Human governance (energy, focus, identity, sustainability)

## Holacracy: Organizational Governance at Scale

Holacracy replaces traditional management hierarchies with:
- Explicit roles and accountabilities
- Formal governance processes
- Continuous organizational adaptation

When augmented with AI (e.g. UiPath automation and agents), Holacracy enables:
- Faster governance cycles
- Reduced human bias in meetings
- Consistent policy enforcement
- Scalable organizational clarity

However, Holacracy — even with AI — primarily governs **organizational logic**, not **human limits**.

## Metronisys: Human-First AI Governance

Metronisys introduces a **Governor layer** that evaluates the *human impact* of decisions before execution.

Metronisys governs:
- Attention and cognitive load
- Energy and burnout risk
- Identity and values alignment
- Automation dependency
- Safety and long-term sustainability

It is **tool-agnostic** and sits above:
- AI agents
- RPA systems
- Workflow engines
- Organizational governance frameworks
